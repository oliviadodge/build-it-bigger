# build-it-bigger
This is my repository for project 4 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. See below for screenshots. For this project I factored reusable functionality into Java and Android libraries, configured a multi-project build to compile libraries and app, and used the Google App Engine to deploy a backend.
Other features include: paid and free flavors; interstitial and banner ads; connected tests; Google Cloud Endpoints module; AsyncTask to load jokes; loading indicator.
